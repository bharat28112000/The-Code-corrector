# The-Code-corrector
1. Implemented a logistic regression technique in conjunction with a One-vs-All strategy to automate the process of program
repair. The focus was on addressing single-line code errors.Successfully predicted the top five error classes for single-line
code issues using the logistic regression-based approach.
2. Tackled the challenge of imbalanced error classes by employing random oversampling. This ensured a balanced
representation of rare error categories in the training data. By fine-tuning hyperparameters, achieved a notably high level
of precision, both overall and on a macro scale across various error classes
